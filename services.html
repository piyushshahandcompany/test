<!-- ================= SME SERVICES ================= -->
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>SME Advisory Services</h2>
    <div class="section-divider"></div>
    <p>
      Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the Indian economy,
      contributing significantly to employment generation, exports, and industrial growth.
      SMEs account for nearly 40% of India’s exports and employ a substantial portion
      of the workforce. However, SMEs often face challenges related to compliance,
      access to finance, taxation complexity, and financial discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Piyush Shah and Company, we provide end-to-end advisory services to SMEs,
      helping them establish strong financial foundations and scalable compliance systems.
      Our services include accounting system design, tax planning, GST compliance,
      cash flow management, audit support, and regulatory filings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work closely with SME promoters to ensure statutory compliance while
      enabling informed decision-making through accurate financial reporting
      and MIS analysis. Our approach is practical, proactive, and aligned with
      long-term business sustainability.

<!-- ================= FINANCE & ADVISORY ================= -->
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Finance & Business Advisory</h2>
    <div class="section-divider"></div>
    <p>
      Whether a business intends to raise capital, expand operations, acquire
      another entity, or realise value through restructuring or exit,
      sound financial advisory is critical. Strategic decisions require
      robust financial analysis, compliance awareness, and risk evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our finance and advisory services cover financial planning, capital structuring,
      investment evaluation, due diligence support, and strategic advisory.
      We assist clients in preparing financial projections, business plans,
      and investor-ready documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      With deep experience across industries, we help businesses align
      financial strategy with regulatory frameworks and commercial objectives,
      ensuring clarity, compliance, and confidence at every stage of growth.

<!-- ================= GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES ================= -->
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Government Grants & Subsidies Advisory</h2>
    <div class="section-divider"></div>
    <p>
      Government grants and subsidies play an important role in promoting
      economic development in a developing country like India. Various central
      and state government schemes are designed to support MSMEs, exporters,
      startups, and manufacturing units.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assist clients in identifying eligible schemes, preparing documentation,
      and ensuring compliance with subsidy conditions. Our services include
      application filing, certification, liaison support, and post-sanction compliance.
    </p>

<!-- ================= TAX ADVISORY ================= -->
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Tax Advisory & Compliance</h2>
    <div class="section-divider"></div>
    <p>
      Increased regulatory scrutiny, frequent amendments, and extensive reporting
      requirements have made tax compliance complex and time-consuming.
      Effective tax advisory requires not just compliance, but strategic planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Piyush Shah and Company, we offer dedicated income tax and GST advisory services,
      including tax planning, return filing, assessments, appeals, and representation
      before tax authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach focuses on lawful tax efficiency, risk mitigation,
      and proactive compliance management to protect client interests
      while ensuring regulatory adherence.

    <p>
      Corporate compliance under the Companies Act, 2013 and allied regulations

      result in penalties and governance risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide end-to-end corporate law advisory including company incorporation,
      ROC filings, director compliance, restructuring, and regulatory advisory.
